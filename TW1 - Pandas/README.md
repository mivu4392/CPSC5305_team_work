Learning objectives:

Be able to use basic visualization tools in Python.
Be able to use Pandas Series and DataFrames. 
Problem-solving problems

You will work on a set of problems for Python Series and Pandas. This work should be done by your assigned team.  

Starter code: TW1_pandas.zip Download TW1_pandas.zip
In the folder, you can find two notebook files:
plot_ex.ipynb: this includes examples of data file reading using Pandas and the use of DataFrame. 
df_ex.ipynb: this is the starter file for TW1. 
Your team can decide how to collaborate on solving problems. 

Github account:

Before you start working on the problems, please check the following:

Make sure that all members in your team have GitHub account AND
Send me an invitation.
My Git username is baew-seattleu
Josh's Git username is joshuapalicka
Also clone your Git repo on your local machine. 
Part 0:
